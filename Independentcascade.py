## Independent Cascade Model outputs a sequence of pairs (v,t) where v is a node and t is the time at which it gets activated.
## It takes as input a graph G and a seed set S. If S is not given, it picks a random vertex as seed.
## The probability of infection is the edge weight between the nodes.

## The linear Threshold model outputs a sequence of pairs (v,t) where v is a node and t is the time at which it gets activated.
## It takes as input a graph G and a seed set S, and threshold th. If S is not given, it picks a random vertex as seed.
## The threshold of of a node u is th(u). If th is not given, it picks a random threshold between 0 and 1.
